        eventlog
        ========
        
        ``eventlog`` is a simple app that provides an easy and clean
        interface for logging diagnostic as well as business intelligence
        data about activity that occurs in your site.
        
        There is optional Pusher (http://pusher.com) support baked in so
        that if you add a ``PUSHER_CONFIG`` to settings, your events will
        also be sent to Pusher as well as your database. Using this feature
        you can write a simple Pusher client to aggregate activity across
        multiple sites in a dashboard showing live activity.
        
        Out of the box using this does write to the database (and if Pusher
        is enabled, write to an http connection). For small sites, it should
        be good enough to use inline but you might at some point want to
        consider wrapping calls to the ``log()`` method and queue them in
        a job manager like ``celery`` or ``pyres`` so that the calls become
        asyncronous.
